What is focus in JavaScript?

- Focus means an element (like an input box, textarea, or button) is active and ready to receive input from the user.
- When you click inside a text box or use the Tab key to move into it â†’ that element gets focus.
- Only one element at a time can have focus on a page.

What is blur?

- The blur event happens when an element loses focus.
- In other words, if you click inside the input field (focus), and then click outside it, the blur event is triggered.
