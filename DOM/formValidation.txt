ðŸ“˜ Form Validation in JavaScript â€” Notes

ðŸ”¹ What is Form Validation?

Form validation is the process of checking the data entered by the user before it is sent to the server.
It helps to ensure correctness, security, and better user experience.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Validation

Client-Side Validation
Done in the browser using JavaScript (or HTML5 attributes).
Immediate feedback (faster, user-friendly).
Example: checking if an email is in the correct format before submitting.   

Server-Side Validation
Done on the server after form submission.
More secure (prevents bypassing validation by disabling JavaScript).
Should always be used along with client-side validation.
