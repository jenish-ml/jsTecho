üîπ What is LocalStorage?

LocalStorage is a web storage API in JavaScript.
It allows you to store key‚Äìvalue pairs in a web browser.
Data stored in localStorage has no expiration time (it stays until deleted manually or by code).
Data is saved per domain, so different websites cannot access each other‚Äôs storage.
