. What is forEach?

forEach is a built-in array method that lets you iterate over each element of an array.
Unlike for or while, you don’t manually manage the loop counter — it automatically gives you the element (and optionally the index and array itself) in each iteration.
It is used only for arrays, not for objects (for objects, you use for...in or Object.entries()).

Syntax:

array.forEach(function(element, index, array) {
    // code to execute
});
• element → Current array element
• index (optional) → Current element index
• array (optional) → The array being iterated
