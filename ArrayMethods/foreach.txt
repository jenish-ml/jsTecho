Difference between filter and map:
- filter creates a new array with elements that pass the test, while map creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element.
- filter does not modify the original array, while map also does not modify the original array but transforms its elements.
- map is used for transforming data, while filter is used for selecting data based on a condition.
- map returns a new array of the same length as the original, while filter may return a shorter array if some elements do not pass the test.
