Anonymous Function in JavaScript

An anonymous function is a function without a name. It’s often used when you don’t need to reuse the function elsewhere.

Syntax:
const functionName = function(parameters) {
    // code to execute
};

Key Points:
They have no name.
Useful for one-time use functions.
Common in callbacks, event handlers, and functional programming.
Cannot be directly called by name (because they don’t have one).
Often replaced with arrow functions for shorter syntax.
