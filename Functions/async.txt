What is Async/Await?

 - async and await are syntactic sugar built on top of Promises (introduced in ES2017/ES8).
 - They make asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability.

async Function

Declares a function as asynchronous.
Always returns a Promise (implicitly).
If you return a value, it gets wrapped inside a Promise.

await Keyword

Can only be used inside an async function.
Pauses the execution until the Promise is resolved/rejected.
Makes async code look synchronous.
