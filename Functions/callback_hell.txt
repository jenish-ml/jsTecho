What is Callback Hell?

Callback Hell happens when callbacks are nested inside other callbacks multiple levels deep.
This makes code hard to read, debug, and maintain.
Usually seen when performing sequential async operations.

Problems with Callback Hell

Readability – Code looks messy ("pyramid structure").
Maintainability – Hard to modify or add logic.
Error Handling – Needs lots of checks.
Scalability – Adding new async tasks makes it worse.

Solutions to Callback Hell

Modularize – Break into separate functions.
Use Promises – Flatten structure with .then().
Use Async/Await – Makes code look synchronous.

What is the difference between callback hell and Promises?
→ Callback hell is deeply nested callbacks; Promises flatten the structure.
