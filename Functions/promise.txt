What is a Promise in JavaScript?

A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (success) or failure (error) of an asynchronous operation.
It is mainly used to handle asynchronous tasks like fetching data from an API, reading files, or waiting for timers.

Why do we use Promises?

To handle asynchronous operations easily.
To avoid callback hell (deeply nested callbacks).
To write cleaner and more readable code.
To manage success (resolve) and failure (reject) separately.

States of a Promise

A Promise has 3 states:

Pending – Initial state (operation not completed yet).
Fulfilled – Operation completed successfully (resolve).
Rejected – Operation failed (reject).

resolve - .then()
reject - .catch()
